There is a simple form validation with pure js (almost) and jQuery UI date picker.
The project can be assembled (run npm install and gulp commands) if it needed.
the source JS code is in <strong>assets/js/common.js</strong> (in dist folder code translated with babel)
I builded validation as component with methods (email, text etc.) using ES6 classes. 

Thanks for considering my test. I will be appreciated for feedback about my code. I really need it. 
With best regards, Ruslan.
