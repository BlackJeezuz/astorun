There is a simple form validation with pure js (almost) and jQuery UI date picker. <br>
The project can be assembled (run npm install and gulp commands) if it needed. <br>
the source JS code is in <strong>assets/js/common.js</strong> (in dist folder code translated with babel). <br>

Thanks for considering my test. I will be appreciated for feedback about my code. I really need it. <br>
With best regards, Ruslan.
