# repository-test


Hi there:D

First of all u must to clone or download this repository.
I haven't experiance with webpack or vue cli or something in this way (ready to learn, by the way:D), 
so i've been using Gulp. And following from this u must have node.js (https://nodejs.org/en) at your computer.
Gulp should be installed globally. 
1) For installing gulp globally run command promt and run the following command: npm i gulp -g 
2) After that u must install node_modules, run in base dir with index.html: npm install 
3) And the last move it's running your server, run: gulp

I know that it's not what you expected but in any case it was interesting and usefull task for me:)
Thank you for considering my task I would appreciate a feedback 
to find out what I need to learn and where are my weaknesses

Yours faithfully,
Ruslan Lukianenko
